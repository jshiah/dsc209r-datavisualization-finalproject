**Overview of Final Project**
This dataset is extracted from Google Trends from 2001 to 2020 across the globe, and our team mapped out common trends that are searched in the Google search engine by countries across the 2 decades. The categories are pre-filled, structured text and for the non-English categories, we plan on using filtering methods to group similar categories together with the English categories to process the data. We intend to make 3 visualizations: (a) A bar chart of the 5 most common names searched worldwide, which will be updated for every year in the data set when the user presses a play button. The user can change the country from a drop-down menu that will update this visualization to match only searches from that country. (b) (c)  The objective of this project is to effectively show the audience how people across the globe have common interests and queries.
