    <h1>Final Project: Worldwide Google Searches, 2001 to 2020!</h1>
    <h6>Welcome to Joyce, Sneha and Laura's exploration of worldwide google search trends over 
        the first 2 decades of the 21st century! We are excited to show you how some trends 
        are limited to certain geographical areas, but most trends are worldwide in our ever
        connected society. We hope you enjoy!

    <h1>Google Trends: Top 5 Searches Over the Years</h1>

    Note: In the chart, bars are ranked from 5 to 1, where rank 5 (leftmost bar) represents the most searched item globally, and rank 1 (rightmost bar) represents the 5th most searched item globally for category in each year.
</div>

    <!-- Separate chart containers for Chart 1 and Chart 2 -->
    <div id="chart1">
        <!-- Chart 1 will be rendered here -->
        <!-- Buttons for controlling Chart 1 placed directly under it -->
        <div id="chart1-controls">
            <button id="play-button1">Play Chart 1</button>
            <button id="pause-button1">Pause Chart 1</button>
            <button id="restart-button1">Restart Chart 1</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Chart 1:</strong> Above, you will see the top 5 searches in a variety of subjects over time.
        The most common search is on the left and the 5th most common search is on the right. 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Annotations: </strong> There were thoughtful annotations made to indicate important 
        findings and aid in the user being able to understand the chart. 
        The static tooltip describes that the bar height relates to the 
        rank of the search enabling the user to better comprehend the purpose of the chart. 
        The slanted x-axis label provides readability and the changing chart title shows the 
        top five searches for each category demonstrating important modifications over time. In addition, 
        the consistency in coloring of the five bars for each category within each year allows the user to 
        easily notice trends.

    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Takeaway: </strong> One significant takeaway from this 
        chart is that search behavior on a global scale is impacted by 
        cultural shifts and specific events. For example, in the year 
        2020 within the People category, two of the top five searches 
        were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris which relates to the 2020 
        presidential election. This visualization succeeds in indicating 
        these patterns because it integrates interactive visual elements 
        like play, pause and restart buttons with clear visual design to 
        allow the user to examine the data in depth and see how various 
        search categories change over time. This method enables the chart 
        to be engaging and knowledgeable in narrating modifications in 
        global search trends over time. The main idea is that important patterns 
        and changes in human behavior can be greatly highlighted from data visualization 
        providing information on how they find and gain knowledge. 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Challenge(s):</strong> One challenge in creating this chart was figuring 
        out how to display a massive amount of data in an interpretable 
        way. While the person creating the chart knows the meaning behind the visualization, 
        the user may not be able to comprehend the visualization right away when they see it, so 
        the person creating the chart has to consider what the user will think when they see the chart. 
        As a result, the chart was modified little by little over time to make it more easily interpretable 
        for the user. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div id="chart2">
        <!-- Chart 2 will be rendered here -->
        <div id="chart2-controls">
            <button id="play-button2">Play Chart 2</button>
            <button id="pause-button2">Pause Chart 2</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Chart 2:</strong> Above, you will see how the top 10 searches in a single category can change
        over time. This is a good way to see how long it takes trend to emerge and how long 
        they will stick around for! 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Bar chart races are well suited to represent each year's top 10 most globally searched categories from the Google search engine. 
        This specific dataset includes thousands of non-English data, but due to the time constraints and limited capabilities of current GPT models 
        and NLP libraries to translate all non-English category names into English for further model fine-tuning, 
        data harmonization could not be completed on-time. Thus only English category names were accounted for in these visuals. 
        and explains why specific years may look quite sparse in terms of data on Google searches. 

    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Annotations: </strong> Instead of statically laying out all 21 bar charts across the page, building an interactive and animated chart 
        with all 21 years’ worth of data aggregated will engage the user’s attention much more. 
        Additionally, incorporating Pause and Play buttons to control the pace of the displays 
        will allow the user to pause and focus on particular data points or time periods as needed. Unlike its static counterpart, 
        this practice of animated visualizations incorporate storytelling by showing how each year's trends fare and avoids repetition
        of 21 similar visualizations that may overwhelm the user. By differentiating categories by contrasting colors and including tooltips 
        that provide information on number of searches and specific Category names, 
        the audience will be able to see the story unfold over how long trends last throughout the years. 

    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Takeaway: </strong> From this visualization, one key takeaway is that contrary to expectations of the "News" Category dominating 
        Google searches, the "People" category -- including celebrities and moguls -- frequently held the 
        #1 position as the most searched category from the early 2010s to 2020. 
        With this interactive visual, users will stay engaged due to its interactive elements and identify that the "People" category 
        sustained its relevancy the longest, showing its consistency in keeping up as a trending topic 
        for a number of years. In the meantime, other categories fluctuate in relevancy throughout the years. 
        This makes the storytelling of the dataset much more memorable for the audience.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Challenge(s):</strong> The challenge in building this bar chart race was identifying the most efficient and accurate way to pre-process 
        the dataset. D3.js may be brilliant with data visualization, but performing data aggregation and 
        preprocessing proves to be subpar compared to Python and its libraries. 
        The best way to go about finding the top 10 categories and its counts per year was by 
        first preprocessing and creating a filtered CSV file from Python Pandas, 
        then having D3.js work off from the filtered CSV in order to build the bar chart race accurately.
