    <h1>Final Project: Worldwide Google Searches, 2001 to 2020!</h1>
    <h6>Welcome to Joyce, Sneha and Laura's exploration of worldwide google search trends over 
        the first 2 decades of the 21st century! We are excited to show you how some trends 
        are limited to certain geographical areas, but most trends are worldwide in our ever
        connected society. We hope you enjoy!

    Note: In the chart, bars are ranked from 5 to 1, where rank 5 (leftmost bar) represents the most searched item globally, and rank 1 (rightmost bar) represents the 5th most searched item globally for category in each year.

    <!-- Separate chart containers for Chart 1 and Chart 2 -->
    <div id="chart1">
        <!-- Chart 1 will be rendered here -->
        <!-- Buttons for controlling Chart 1 placed directly under it -->
        <div id="chart1-controls">

    <p><strong>Chart 1:</strong> Above, you will see the top 5 searches in a variety of subjects over time.
        The most common search is on the left and the 5th most common search is on the right.

        <strong>Chart 2:</strong> Above, you will see how the top 10 searches in a single category can change
        over time. This is a good way to see how long it takes trend to emerge and how long 
        they will stick around for!

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Bar chart races are well suited to represent each year's top 10 most globally searched categories from the Google search engine. 
        This specific dataset includes thousands of non-English data, but due to the time constraints and limited capabilities of current GPT models 
        and NLP libraries to translate all non-English category names into English for further model fine-tuning, 
        data harmonization could not be completed on-time. Thus only English category names were accounted for in these visuals. 
        and explains why specific years may look quite sparse in terms of data on Google searches. 
        Instead of statically laying out all 21 bar charts across the page, building an interactive and animated chart 
        with all 21 years’ worth of data displayed for 2 seconds each and allowing the user to use the Pause and Play buttons 
        to control the pace of the displays will engage the user’s attention much more. Unlike its static counterpart, 
        this practice of animated visualizations incorporate storytelling by showing how each year's trends fare and avoids repetition
        of 21 similar visualizations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        With each category’s differentiation in color and tooltips that provide information on # of searches 
        and specific Category names, the audience will be able to see the story unfold over how long trends last throughout the years. 
        With this interactive visualization, users will stay engaged due to its interactive elements and spot trends 
        more quickly, showing how certain categories stay relative for a consistent number of years while other categories 
        may quickly die out in terms of popularity. This makes the storytelling of the dataset much more memorable for the audience.
